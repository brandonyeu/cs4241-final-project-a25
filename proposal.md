Study buddy matcher - like “dating app for study sessions,” matches students based on subjects & schedules & study habits/preferences.

## Project Description:
We are planning to create a study buddy matching app that matches students looking for a study buddy based on classes, subjects, schedules, study habits, and other preferences. When users create an account, they record some static info (contact info, personal info, etc.). When they go to a spot “looking for a study buddy” they can fill out a form that records their course info, schedule, and study preferences. In the background, there will be logic to find weighted euclidean distance to determine good fits for the user. The application then shows the top 3 best matches and their contact information for the student. Some ideas for the preference form are listed below:

## Basic Info:
- Name / username
- Contact info
- Major / year
- Courses currently taking?
- Language

## Personality & Social Style:
- Personality: extroverted/introverted/flexible
- Communication style: likes to yap / strictly locks in on academics / either is fine
- Study Group Size Preference: 1-on-1, small group(2-4), large group(5+)

## Study Habits / Preferences:
- Noise level: silent/background music/chatter okay(talking)
- Preferred study time: Morning / afternoon / evening / night
- Study pace: fast (cover lost quickly) / steady / slow & detailed
- Break style: short frequent breaks / long breaks / few breaks
- Preferred location: online(zoom/discord) / on campus / cafe / dorm
- Study goals: just want to pass the class lol / get highest grades / accountability (body doubling)
- Study topic: Exams / Projects / Quizzes / Homework
